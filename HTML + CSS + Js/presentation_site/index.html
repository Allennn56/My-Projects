            <h1>What Makes JavaScript Popular?</h1>

            <p>The question you’re probably wondering is, what makes JavaScript so widely adopted and popular? Here are
                some good
                reasons I personally believe contributed to the popularity of JavaScript.

            <h2>1.JavaScript Code Is Executable on the Client and Server</h2>
            <p>We refer the client as the browser and the server as outside the browser context. You’re most likely
                reading the article
                on a browser or the native Medium app, which are both clients. The article is fetched from the server
                and served on the
                client.</p>
            <p>In 2009, Node.js was released. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment
                that executes
                JavaScript code outside of a browser.</p>
            <p>This was an absolute game changer. Before, you were constrained by the browser. With the release of Node,
                you could
                write your application in uni language manner, meaning your back and front end in one language.</p>

            <h1>2.Flexible and Dynamic</h1>
            <p>JavaScript gives us a lot of freedom and choices to make. To really understand how dynamic JavaScript is,
                let’s compare the widely known “hello world” between Java and JavaScript.</p>

            <h1>3.Huge Active Community</h1>
            <p>The JavaScript developer community hasn’t always been calm. Since the JavaScript ES2015 release, there
                are lots of new
                frameworks, build tools, and new language features to learn. This constant “keeping up” feeling led to
                the term
                JavaScript fatigue.</p>
            <p>JavaScript Fatigue: There are dozens of JavaScript frameworks, and all of them argue that their
                philosophy is best. And
                if you somehow found time to learn them all, after you learned the last one, you would hear that the
                first one has
                changed everything and you need to try it again. You would never get any actual work done. You’d spend
                all of your time
                just trying out frameworks.</p>
