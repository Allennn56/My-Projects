                    What is the C++ programming language used for?
                </h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    C++ is the fastest Object-Oriented programming language. It
                    is used in developing the suites of a game tool, operating
                    systems, photo editing software, database management
                    software, GUI based applications. C++ is largely used on
                    programs for optimisation, for example, most of the
                    applications of the adobe systems including Illustrator,
                    Photoshop, etc. are developed using C++; MySQL, Microsoft
                    Windows OS and many more.

                <h3 class="faq-title">Is C++ high or low-level language?</h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    C++ is a high-level language as it offers the best tool for
                    the intensive function of CPU. However, with a surge in
                    languages like Java, C# and Ruby, this language can also be
                    grouped in low or middle-level language.

                <h3 class="faq-title">Is Python better than C++?</h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    When it comes to languages, it is all about their features
                    and implementation. C++ is a single program and a mid-level
                    language that does not provide all built-in features and
                    therefore, needs to get compiled on every operating system
                    individually. On the other hand, Python is an interpreted
                    language and allows you to split your program into modules.

                <h3 class="faq-title">Is C++ good for AI?</h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    C++ is good for AI because it has the fastest code execution
                    and allows extensive use of algorithms. It is one of the
                    efficient languages that use AI techniques therefore, it is
                    a preferred language for AI.

            <div class="faq">
                <h3 class="faq-title">Is C++ object-oriented language?</h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    Yes, C++ is an Object-Oriented language because it comprises
                    of components like Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction,
                    Encapsulation, Class, Object and Abstraction. These
                    components will help you to complete a project.
