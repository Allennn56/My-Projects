                            Deputy
                            Commander. Reflecting
                            upon his choice of Patel to lead the Kheda Satyagraha, Ganshi Said, ‘Many were prepared to
                            follow me, but I could not
                            make up my mind as to who should be my deputy commander. Then I thought of Vallabhbhai.
