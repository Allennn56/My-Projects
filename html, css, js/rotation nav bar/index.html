                <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
                <small>Published by Naveen</small>
                <p>
                    Sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence are
                    some of the most important and promising technological
                    developments of our time, especially in a business context.
                    Algorithms can improve the targeting of communication and
                    offerings of companies and platforms, often even to the
                    point of individualization. AI is a branch of computer
                    science that deals with the simulation of intelligent
                    behavior in computers or the ability of a machine to imitate
                    intelligent human behavior. In other words, it can not only
                    support human work and decision- making processes but could
                    eventually replace them altogether. Thus, AI is the first
                    field that threatens to compete with humanity in a domain
                    long considered unreachable for machines: making intelligent
                    decisions.

                <p>
                    The variation of the answers is very high. The AI is granted
                    least authority in matters of personnel and human resources.
                    Especially the hiring decision itself should be made by only
                    a person – at least according to about half of the Leaders
                    of Tomorrow. However, more than 40% think that AI can
                    preselect options. The power of influence by creating
                    options seems to be perceived as smaller than by making the
                    final decision. But as the development of options creates a
                    shortlist and narrows the scope of possibilities, the
                    perceived level of control exerted by making the final
                    decision may be overestimated or – to put it bluntly – be
                    only an illusion of control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the task of developing products, far more
                    Leaders of Tomorrow suggest that AI should be granted
                    influence. Just a quarter of the respondents would do this
                    creative task without the support of artificial
                    intelligence, while nearly 60% would use it for the
                    development of options. So, creating the shortlist is the
                    preferred type of AI assistance again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The greatest extent of AI involvement is recommended for a
                    third task, granting discounts or setting surcharges or
                    customers. Every fifth participant even thinks that these
                    decisions should be left entirely to AI. And similar
                    percentages think that AI should select among
                    human-developed options (34%), or that humans should select
                    among AI-developed options (36%). Thus, 9 out of 10
                    respondents would rely on the AI for this task. Maybe the
                    high level of overall agreement that AI should be involved
                    in decision making in this case can be explained by the fact
                    that AI is already widely – and successfully – applied in a
                    similar task, namely for programmatic buying in online
                    advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, it does not need much imagination to conceive of
                    applying AI solutions to automatic pricing. The interesting
                    questions for the future will be to see which decision tasks
                    are best left to humans, which to AI, and in which ways the
                    two can best cooperate.
